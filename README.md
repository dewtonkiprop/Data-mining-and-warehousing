# Data Mining and Warehousing Project with WEKA

This repository contains code and resources for a data mining and warehousing project using the WEKA tool. The project focuses on visualizing and analyzing datasets, implementing data mining algorithms, and building data warehouses for effective data management and analysis.

## Project Overview

The project aims to explore and analyze datasets using the WEKA tool, a popular suite of machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing tools. It involves the following key tasks:

1. Data Exploration and Visualization: 
   - Use WEKA to explore datasets visually, analyze data distributions, identify patterns, and gain insights into the data.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Cleanse and preprocess datasets to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, preparing them for analysis.

3. Data Mining:
   - Implement various data mining algorithms available in WEKA, such as classification, clustering, association rule mining, and regression, to extract valuable patterns and knowledge from the data.

4. Model Evaluation and Validation:
   - Evaluate the performance of data mining models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Validate models using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness.

5. Building Data Warehouses:
   - Design and build data warehouses to store and manage large volumes of structured and unstructured data efficiently. Use WEKA for data preprocessing and transformation tasks.
